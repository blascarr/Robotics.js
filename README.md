Robotics.js
===========

Robotics.js is a Javascript framework of the MATLAB Robotic Toolbox created by Peter Corke.

Do you want to learn Robotic in web platform? 
Maybe you have studied Robotics, but you need some programs that are not easily affordable.

Robotics.js is a Framework written in Javascript and integrate many robotic functions that calculates everything related with your own robotic system.
This Framework use other Framewoks, like THREE.js used to draw your systems in a web page.

At first, this work is only a traduction of Robotic Toolbox used in MATLAB, but it can extend for some other areas, like electronics, systems engineering, vision systems, robot design, etc...


There is many documentation that can be used:

Moreover, useful books for this purpose in order to learn robotic.
